## 📚 Structure
---

A **structure** is a user-defined data type in C/C++ that allows grouping of variables of different data types into a single unit. It is an essential feature in programming for organizing related data.

### 🚀 Problems on Structures
---

#### 1. **Create a Structure for Date**  
   Create a structure `date` having three integer data members: `day`, `month`, and `year`.

#### 2. **Create a Structure for Student**  
   Create a structure `student` with data members: `name`, `age`, `roll_no`, marks of 3 subjects, and total marks.

#### 3. **Create, Read, and Display Student Structure**  
   Write a program to create, read, and display the structure of a student having data members: `name`, `age`, `roll_no`, marks of 3 subjects, and total marks.

#### 4. **Create, Read, and Display Employee Structure**  
   Write a program to create, read, and display the structure of an employee having data members: `name`, `id`, `basic_pay`, `hra`, `da`, `pf`, and `total_salary`.

#### 5. **Complex Number Addition Using Structure**  
   Write a program to read two complex numbers, perform addition, and display the resultant complex number using structure.

#### 6. **Create and Perform Time Addition Using Structure**  
   Write a program to create, read, and display the structure of `time` having data members: `hour`, `minute`, and `second`. Perform addition and display the resultant time in hr:min:sec format.

#### 7. **Structure of Multiple Students**  
   Write a program to create, read, and display the structure of `n` students with data members: `name`, `age`, `roll_no`, marks of 3 subjects, and total marks.

#### 8. **Structure of Multiple Employees**  
   Write a program to create, read, and display the structure of `n` employees with data members: `name`, `id`, `basic_pay`, `hra`, `da`, `pf`, and `total_salary`.

#### 9. **Read and Display Student Information**  
   Write a program to read `name`, `roll_number`, marks of 3 subjects, and total marks using structure and display the results.

#### 10. **Structure with Nested Data Members**  
   Write a program to read `name`, `department`, marks of 3 subjects, and date of birth, and display it using structure and nesting of structure.

#### 11. **Structure Passing Using Call by Value**  
   Write a program that shows structure passing through a function using call by value method.

#### 12. **Structure Passing Using Call by Reference**  
   Write a program that shows structure passing in function using call by reference (pointer concept).

#### 13. **Global Structure Declaration in Functions**  
   Write a program that demonstrates using structure in functions with global variable declaration.

#### 14. **Complex Number Multiplication Using Structure**  
   Write a program to perform multiplication of two complex numbers using structure.

### 💡 Tips for Working with Structures
---

+ 📦 **Accessing Members:** Use `.` (dot operator) to access members of a structure variable. If using a pointer to a structure, use `->` (arrow operator).
+ 🔄 **Function Use:** Structures can be passed to functions in C using call by value or call by reference. Use pointers to pass structures by reference to avoid copying large structures.
+ 🧩 **Memory:** Be mindful of memory allocation for structures, especially when dealing with arrays of structures or dynamically allocated memory.
+ 🧑‍💻 **Nested Structures:** You can have structures inside structures for creating more complex data models.
+ 🏷️ **Size of Structure:** Use the `sizeof()` operator to determine the size of a structure.
