  /* syntax:
  
      if (boolean value) 
          statement;

     if more than one statements should be executed in the if statement, we should use curly brackets and should place the statements within the curly brackets.

     syntax:

      if (condition) 
        {
            statement1;
            statement2;
        }
        

    boolean statement can be any expression ike relational,logical etc.
    if the value of the expression is true , then the statement is executed and if the value of the statement is false , then the statement is not executed
