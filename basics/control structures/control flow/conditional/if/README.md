## 📚 Simple If, If-Else, and Else If

This section contains problems that help you practice decision-making in C++ using `if`, `if-else`, and `else if` statements. These are fundamental control structures that allow you to implement decision logic in your programs.

### 🚀 Simple If

---

1. **Check if Number is Even:**  
   Write a program to check if a number is even or not using a simple `if` statement.

2. **Check if Number is Positive:**  
   Write a program to check if the given number is positive using a simple `if` statement.

### 🚀 If-Else

---

3. **Check if Number is Even or Odd:**  
   Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using `if-else` statement.

4. **Check if Number is Positive or Negative:**  
   Write a program to check if the given number is positive or negative using `if-else`.

5. **Check Divisibility by 7:**  
   Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 7 using `if-else`.

6. **Check Divisibility by 3 or 7:**  
   Write a program to check if a number is divisible by 3 or 7 using `if-else`.

7. **Leap Year Check:**  
   Write a program to read a year and check whether it is a leap year or not.

8. **Voting Eligibility Check:**  
   Write a program to read the age and check whether the user is eligible to vote or not.

9. **Free Admission Check (Age):**  
   Write a program to read the age of a person and check if they are no more than 12 years old or at least 65 years old. If so, admission is free; otherwise, they have to pay.

### 🚀 Else If Ladder

---

10. **Check if Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero:**  
    Write a program to check if the given number is positive, negative, or zero using an `else-if` ladder.

11. **Find the Largest of Three Numbers:**  
    Write a program to read three numbers and find the largest using an `if-else-if` ladder.

12. **Grade Based on Total Marks:**  
    Write a program to read the marks of three subjects and calculate the total. Based on the total, display the grade:
    - Total marks >= 240 → A grade  
    - 240 > Total marks >= 180 → B grade  
    - 180 > Total marks >= 150 → C grade  
    - 150 > Total marks >= 120 → D grade  
    - Total marks < 120 → E grade

13. **Find the Quadrant of a Point:**  
    Write a program to read the `x` and `y` coordinates of a point in a 2D coordinate system and print its quadrant.

14. **Find Roots of a Quadratic Equation:**  
    Write a program to read the coefficients of a quadratic equation and find its roots.

15. **Print Number in Words:**  
    Write a program to read a 1-digit number and print it in words.

16. **Armstrong Number Check (3 digits):**  
    Write a program to read a 3-digit number and check if it is an Armstrong number using `else-if`.
