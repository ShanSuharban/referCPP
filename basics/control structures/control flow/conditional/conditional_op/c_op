				---------------------------------------------------
1) write a program to read two numbers and find the largest number using conditional operator?

2) write a program to read two numbers , find the sum if first number greater than or equal to second, find the product otherwise?


3) write a program to evaluate the expression
   y=x^2+5x+2, if x<5
   x+6, otherwise

4) write a program to evaluate the expression
   x^2+2, if x<0
   x+6, if x>0
   5, otherwise

5) write a program to read three numbers and find the largest using conditional operator?
