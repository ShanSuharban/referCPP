1. **Find the Area of a Rectangle:**  
   Write a program to find the area of a rectangle using the `do-while` loop. The program should continuously ask for the dimensions of the rectangle until valid inputs are given.

2. **Sum of N Natural Numbers:**  
   Write a program to find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the `do-while` loop. The program should repeatedly ask for `n` until the user provides a valid positive integer.

3. **Sum of Digits of a Given Number:**  
   Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a given number using the `do-while` loop. The program should continue until the user enters a valid non-negative number.
